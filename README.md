# Sentiment-analysis-Amazon-product-reviews-
Sentiment analysis project using Amazon product review dataset to analyze customer opinions and extract sentiment insights.

I have used the Natural Language Toolkit(NLTK) for easy processing and also used some available modules such as wordcloud 

For analysis I used the vaderSentiment module from NLTK.
Also for visualization i used matplotlib and seaborn.
